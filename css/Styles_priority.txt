Below rule is applicable with styles of same tags: 

1. Inline styles are give 1st priority.
For eg:
 <p style="color: blue"> 
   text </p>
2. style tags/ link tags whichever is read at the bottom of page is finally applied

**Styles with class selectors are given more priority than tags because they are more specific**
**Similarly id is most specific**
** ID-name>Class-name>tag-name **
